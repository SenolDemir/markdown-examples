ava Introduction

	What is Java

		Computer programming language. It enables to write computer instructions using English based commands instead of having to write in numeric codes.
		Simple
		Security
		Object-Oriented
		Platfrom Independence : doesn't care about the opaerating system.

	How Java work

		All source code is first written in plain text files ending with .java
		These  files then compiled into .class by javac compiler
		A .class file does not contain code. It contains bytecodes - the machine language of JVM.
		Then java launcher tool runs your application with an instance of JVM

	Components of Java

		Java Virtual Machine (JVM), 
		Java Runtime Memory (JRE)
		Java Development Kit (JDK)

  		Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 
  			is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't pysically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode

  		JRE (Java Runtime Memory) is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment

  		JDK
  			JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit required to develop applications in Java. When you download JDK, JRE is also downloaded with it.
			In addition to JRE, JDK also contains a number of development tools (compilers, JavaDoc, Java Debugger, etc).


  	What is Core Java
		1- Core Java refers to a collection of libraries rather than just the programming language. It's the purest form of Java primarily used for development of general desktop applications.

		2 - You can consider Core Java as a Basic Java language API/Classes/Lib that is Java SE. Advanced Java is written on top of Core Java beyond Core Java Classes and Library.
